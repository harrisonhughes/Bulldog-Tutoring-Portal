# Bulldog-Tutoring-Portal
## Premise
The Bulldog Tutoring Portal can best be described as the infrastructure of a comprehensive tutoring management system. While the end goal of the application is to provide an accurate and comprehensive list of all tutors - both associated and unassociated with formal tutoring bodies at TSU - the core responsibilities of the program involve the various management activities associated with the creation and upkeep of such a database.

## Environment
The application is open-source and we encourage any and everyone interested in implementing a similar system for their University to look around and see how we approached this challenge. For those who just want to see the finished result, visit our live site at https://BulldogTutoringPortal.com - keep in mind that a new account creation will limit you to that of a student view, and you will be unable to interact with the bulk of the functionality that is reserved for privileged administration accounts. 

## Programs and Dependencies
There are many moving pieces involved in the use and access of our program on a personal device if you wish to view the application in a development setting. We will provide a basic installation description for those unfamiliar with all of these pieces, but feel free to proceed as you would like.
Programs and Dependencies Used: 
-Local Web Server (Apache Recommended)
-MySQL Database Environment (PHPMyAdmin recommended)
-PHP (8.0+ Recommended)
-JavaScript
-HTML/CSS
-PHP Composer (2.7.2 Recommended)
-PHPMailer (Through Composer)
-SimpleXLSX (Through Composer)

## Recommended Installation Steps
The easiest way to begin the process is to download a web development stack onto your local environment. We recommended MAMP, as this is the stack that each member of our group worked with throughout the process.

### Step 1 - MAMP Installation
Navigate to https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/ and begin downloading/Installing the MAMP version specific to your platform. You will not need MAMP Pro. No special installation information is necessary - MAMP should be downloaded directly to your 'Applications' folder.

### Step 2 - Configure MAMP
Navigate to the location MAMP is downloaded, and launch the application. The MAMP dashboard (The initial small interface that displays server status) allows for further configuration using the bars at the top of the screen, including specification of the web server (we tested ours using Apache), PHP version (8.0+ recommended), and port information. 

### Step 3 - Setting up the Environment
